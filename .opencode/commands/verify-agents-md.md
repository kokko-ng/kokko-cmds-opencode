# Verify AGENTS.md Accuracy

Audit AGENTS.md to ensure it accurately reflects the current state of the codebase.

## When to Use

- After significant codebase changes
- When onboarding to a new project
- During periodic documentation reviews

## Arguments

Usage: `/verify-agents-md [agents-md-path]`

- `agents-md-path` - Path to AGENTS.md file (default: ./AGENTS.md)

If `$ARGUMENTS` is provided, use it as the file path.

## Steps

### 1. Read Current AGENTS.md

Read and understand all instructions in the AGENTS.md file.

### 2. Verify Each Section

**Repository Context:**

- Does the description match actual project purpose?
- Is the project structure accurate?

**Package Management:**

```bash
# Check which package manager is used
ls pyproject.toml uv.lock package.json pnpm-lock.yaml \
   yarn.lock requirements.txt 2>/dev/null
```

**Build/Run Commands:**

- Test each documented command
- Verify they execute successfully

**File Structure:**

- Check that documented paths exist
- Verify directory structure matches description

**Dependencies:**

- Confirm mentioned tools are in dependency files
- Check version requirements are current

**Configuration:**

- Verify config files exist
- Check that documented settings match actual files

### 3. Scan for Missing Context

Identify important aspects not documented:

**Entry Points:**

- Main files, scripts, or commands
- How to run the application

**Testing:**

- How to run tests
- Test frameworks used

**Environment Setup:**

- Required environment variables
- .env file requirements

**Key Patterns:**

- Architectural patterns used
- Coding conventions

**External Services:**

- APIs, databases, or services used

### 4. Check for Outdated Information

Look for:

- References to deleted files or directories
- Deprecated commands or workflows
- Old dependency versions
- Obsolete configuration instructions

### 5. Update AGENTS.md

Fix any inaccuracies found:

- Remove outdated information
- Add missing critical context
- Update changed commands
- Correct file paths

### 6. Validate Changes

After updates, verify:

- All documented commands execute successfully
- All referenced paths exist
- Instructions are clear and actionable

## Error Handling

| Issue | Cause | Resolution |
| ----- | ----- | ---------- |
| Command fails | Outdated or wrong command | Update to correct command |
| Path not found | File moved or deleted | Update path or remove reference |
| Missing context | Documentation gap | Add necessary information |

## Success Criteria

- All documented commands work
- All referenced paths exist
- No outdated information remains
- Missing critical context added
- AGENTS.md accurately reflects codebase
