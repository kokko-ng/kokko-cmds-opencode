# Azure Cost Analysis

Generate a comprehensive cost breakdown of Azure subscription resources.

## Prerequisites

Ensure Azure CLI is authenticated: `az account show`

## Process

### 1. Confirm Target Subscription

ALWAYS ask the user to confirm:

- Which subscription to analyze
- Specific resource group to focus on (or all)
- Time period (default: MonthToDate)

Never assume subscription or resource group. List available options if needed:

```bash
az account list --query "[].{Name:name, Id:id}" -o table
az group list --query "[].name" -o tsv
```

### 2. Get Cost Data

Fetch cost data for the specified period (default: last 30 days):

```bash
# Current billing period costs by resource group
az cost query --type ActualCost \
  --dataset-grouping name=ResourceGroup type=Dimension \
  --timeframe MonthToDate

# Daily cost trend
az cost query --type ActualCost \
  --dataset-grouping name=ServiceName type=Dimension \
  --timeframe MonthToDate --dataset-aggregation totalCost=Sum

# Forecast for current month
az cost query --type AmortizedCost --timeframe MonthToDate
```

### 3. Resource Group Breakdown

For each resource group, show:

- Total cost MTD
- Top 3 cost drivers (specific resources)
- Cost trend (increasing/decreasing/stable)
- Percentage of total spend

### 4. Service Category Analysis

Break down by service type:

- Compute (VMs, Container Apps, Functions)
- Storage (Blob, Cosmos DB, SQL)
- AI Services (OpenAI, Cognitive Services)
- Networking (Bandwidth, Load Balancers)
- Other

### 5. Anomaly Detection

Flag any of these conditions:

- Daily cost spike > 20% above 7-day average
- New resources appearing that weren't present last week
- Resources with zero usage but ongoing cost (idle resources)
- Resources approaching quota limits

### 6. Optimization Suggestions

Based on usage patterns, suggest:

- Underutilized resources that could be downsized
- Reserved instance opportunities for consistent workloads
- Dev/test resources that could use B-series VMs
- Storage tier optimizations (hot vs cool vs archive)

## Output Format

```text
## Azure Cost Summary (MTD)

Total Spend: $X,XXX.XX
Forecast End of Month: $X,XXX.XX
vs Last Month: +/- XX%

### By Resource Group
| Resource Group | Cost | % of Total | Trend |
|---------------|------|------------|-------|
| ... | ... | ... | ... |

### Top Cost Drivers
1. [Resource Name] - $XXX.XX (reason)
2. ...

### Alerts
- [Any anomalies or concerns]

### Optimization Opportunities
- [Specific actionable suggestions]
```

## Arguments

- `$ARGUMENTS` - Optional: "daily" for daily breakdown, "weekly" for weekly,
  or resource group name to filter
