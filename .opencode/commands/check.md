# Pre-commit Check

Iteratively run `pre-commit run --all-files` and address every reported
linting/formatting issue until the command exits cleanly with no failures.
Do not skip hooks, disable rules, or add ignores/exclusions. Only introduce
an exception if it's truly unavoidable; in that case, document the rationale
and keep the scope as narrow as possible.
